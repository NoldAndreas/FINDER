# Show clustering

This app was built on this [demo app](https://dash-gallery.plotly.host/dash-svm/).

It also uses inspiration and code examples from the following lists of apps.

- Dash plotly [Examples](https://github.com/ucg8j/awesome-dash) and [Dash Resources](https://dash.plotly.com/installation)
- a nice list of examples: [Link](https://dash.gallery/Portal/)
- nice example of visualization of image classification [Link](https://dash.gallery/dash-image-segmentation/)

Especially from the following apps:

- Example 1 [Image segmentation](https://dash.gallery/dash-label-properties/)
- Example 2 [Image processing app which loads images](https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/tree/main/apps/dash-image-processing)
- Example 3 [Image segmentation](https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/tree/main/apps/dash-image-segmentation)
- Example 4 [SVM explorer](https://github.com/plotly/dash-sample-apps/tree/main/apps/dash-svm)
